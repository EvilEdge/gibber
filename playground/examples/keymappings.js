key mappings
   
This tutorial-that-is-not-really-a-tutorial
just lists all the various keystroke mappings
in gibber and provides explanations as needed.

********** Running Code ***********
(also see running/stopping code tutorial)

- run current line or selection at start of next measure = Ctrl+Enter
- run current line or selection immediately = Shift+Enter
- run "block" of code at start of next measure = Alt+Enter
- run "block" of code immediately = Shift+Alt+Enter

********** Clearing Audiovisuals ***********
- clear = Ctrl+. OR Shift+Ctrl+.

on some keyboards Ctrl+. might not work... in this case
try ctrl+shift+.

********** Console ***********
(also see using the console tutorial)

- open the console (this is a browser shortcut, not gibber specific)
               chrome/edge               firefox
win/lin |   ctrl + shift + j    |    ctrl + shift + i
mac     | command + option + j  |  command + option + i

- clear the console = Ctrl+\

********** Saving & Loading Preload Code  ***********
preload code runs as soon as gibber loads. it's a good
way to initialize small scripts / preferences etc.

- Load preload code into editor for editing = shift+ctrl+l

********** Editor Font Size  ***********
- Bigger = Ctrl+=
- Smaller = Ctrl+-

When camera control is enabled, use the following
keys to navigate the 3D scene:

- wasd = move in four directions
- arrow keys = turn in four directions
- alt = move / turn faster while holding this down

********** Misc  ***********
- hide code and top bar = ctrl + h
