<h1 id="pattern">Pattern</h1>
<p>Patterns are functions that output values from an internal list that is typically passed as an argument when the pattern is first created. These lists can be manipulated in various ways, influencing the output of the patterns. Alternatively, <code>filters</code> placed on the pattern (each filter is simply a function expected to return an array of values) can also change the output of the pattern dynamically, without affecting its underlying list.</p>
<p>Whenever you sequence any method or property in Gibber, Pattern(s) are created behind the scenes to handle sequencer output. All methods of the pattern object can be additionally sequenced; you can also sequence the <code>start</code>, <code>end</code>, and <code>stepSize</code> properties.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>a = Synth( &#39;bleep&#39; )

// two patterns are created when notes are sequences. 
// The `values` pattern determines the output,
// while the `durations` pattern determines timing.

a.note.seq( [0,1,2,3], [1/4,1/8] )

a.note.values.reverse()
// a.note.values now equals [3,2,1,0]

a.note.values.scale( 2 )
// a.note.values now equals [6,4,2,0]

// You can also pass Patterns directly to sequencing calls

p = Pattern( 4,5,6,7 )
a.note.seq( p, 1/4 )

p.rotate.seq( 1,1 )</code></pre>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>start</em> : Int. The first index of the underlying list that will be used for output. For examples, if a pattern has values <code>[0,1,2]</code> and the <code>start</code> property is 1 then the pattern will output 1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2... skipping the 0-index item in the list.</li>
<li><em>end</em> : Int. The last index of the underlying list that will be used for output. For examples, if a pattern has values <code>[0,1,2]</code> and the <code>end</code> property is 1 then the pattern will output 0,1,0,1,0,1... skipping the 2-index item in the list.</li>
<li><em>phase</em> : Int. This is the next index in the underlying list that the pattern will output.</li>
<li><em>values</em> : Array. The underlying list used by the pattern to determine output.</li>
<li><em>original</em> : Array. A copy of the original values used to instantiate the pattern. These values can be used to restore the pattern to its original state after any transformations have been made using the <code>pattern.reset()</code> method.</li>
<li><em>storage</em> : Array. The current permutation of a pattern can be stored at any time with a call to the <code>pattern.store()</code> method. Every stored pattern is placed in the <code>pattern.storage</code> array. The <code>pattern.switch</code> method can be used to switch between stored permutations.</li>
<li><em>stepSize</em> : Float. Default 1. The amount that the phase is increased / decreased by each time the pattern outputs. For example, a <code>pattern.stepSize</code> of -1 means that the pattern will play in reverse. A <code>stepSize</code> of .5 means that each value in the list will be repeated before advancing to the next index.</li>
<li><em>integersOnly</em> : Boolean. Default false. In certain cases (for example, scale degrees) we can ensure that any transformations applied to the pattern only result in integer values by setting this property to be true. For example, if a pattern has the original values of [2,3,4,5] and <code>pattern.scale(.5)</code> is applied, the values would normally then become [1,1.5,2,2.5]. By setting the value of <code>pattern.integersOnly</code> to be true, the values instead become [1,2,2,3] as the floats are rounded up.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>reverse</em>: Reverse the current ordering of the pattern&#39;s <code>values</code> array.</li>
<li><em>range</em>( Array, or Int,Int ): Set both the start and end properties with a single method call. <code>pattern.range</code> can be called in two forms. In the first, both the start and the end values are passed as separate arguments. In the second, a single array is passed containing the start and the end values. This allows the range to be easily sequenced with calls to Rndi, for example: <code>pattern.range.seq( Rndi( 0,5,2 ), 1/2 )</code>. Note that if the value for start is lower than the value for end, this method will automatically switch the values.</li>
<li><em>set</em>( Array or list of values): Replace the current <code>pattern.values</code> array with new members.</li>
<li><em>repeat</em>( List of values ): Repeat certain values (not indices) in an array a certain number of times. When passing arguments, the even numbered arguments are the values you want to have repeated, while the odd values represent how many times each one should be played. For example, given the pattern [0,2,4] and the line <code>pattern.repeat( 0,2,4,2)</code> the pattern output would be 0,0,2,4,4 through one cycle (both 0 and 4 repeated ). This is particularly useful to line up odd time values; for example, if a pattern has 1/6 notes you can specify a repeat of 3 to make sure it lines up with a 1/2 note grid.</li>
<li><em>reset</em>: Return values to their original state at pattern creation.</li>
<li><em>store</em>: Push the current permutation of the pattern to the <code>pattern.storage</code> array.</li>
<li><em>switch</em>( Int ): Switch the values outputted by the pattern to a stored index in the <code>pattern.storage</code> array</li>
<li><em>transpose</em> ( Number ): Add argument to all numerical values in the pattern. If a pattern consists of an array of chords, each member of each chord will be modified. For example [[0,2,4], [1,3,5]] transposed by 1 becomes [[1,3,5], [2,4,6]]</li>
<li><em>scale</em> ( Number ): Multiply all numerical values in the pattern by argument. If a pattern consists of an array of chords, each member of each chord will be modified. For example [[0,2,4], [1,3,5]] scaled by 2 becomes [[0,4,8], [2,6,10]]</li>
<li><em>shuffle</em>: Randomize the order of values found in the <code>pattern.values</code> array.</li>
<li><em>flip</em>: Change the positions of pattern members so that the position of the highest member becomes the position of the lowest member, the position of the second highest becomes the position of the second lowest etc.</li>
<li>_invert: Similar to the technique from serialist compositions. Assume that the zero-index member of the pattern is our axis. Flip all other pattern members to the other side of the access. Thus, a member that is two higher than the zero-index member now becomes two lower.</li>
<li><em>rotate</em>( Int ): Shift the positions of all pattern members by the argument. For example, a pattern of <code>[0,1,2,3]</code> that is rotated by 1 becomes <code>[3,0,1,2]</code>.</li>
</ul>
