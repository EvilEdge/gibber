<h1 id="drums">Drums</h1>
<p>A sampled drum kit with an attached sequencer for quick beat construction. The first argument to the constructor allows you to easily define beats using the following syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li>x : kick drum hit</li>
<li>o : snare drum hit</li>
<li>* : close hihat</li>
<li>- : open hihat</li>
<li>. : rest</li>
</ul>
<p>Drums objects are basically hybrid sequencers / unit generators; this means that you can call most unit generator methods, ( such as drums.fx.add() ) as well as most sequencer methods ( such as drums.stop() and drums.start() ). By default, the constructor assumes that you want each note in your sequence to have a duration equal to one divided by the number of notes you specify. For example, if you specify a four-note sequence the Drums sequencer will assume you want each note to be a quarter note in duration. You can also specify a duration explicitly as a second parameter to the constructor.</p>
<p>There are a few different drum kits that come with Gibber (with hopefully more to follow). The kits are electronic (the default), original and beatbox. The example below shows how to load a different than the default electronic one.</p>
<p>Finally, note that each individual sound is actually an instance of the Gibber Sampler object. This means you can add effects to the individual sounds in addition to the kit as a whole.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>a = Drums( <span class="string">'xoxo'</span> ) <span class="comment">// each note is a quarter note in duration  </span>
a.fx.add( Delay( <span class="number">1</span>/<span class="number">64</span>) )  

b = Drums( <span class="string">'***-'</span>, <span class="number">1</span>/<span class="number">8</span> ) <span class="comment">// each note is an eighth note  </span>
b.hat.fx.add( Distortion() )  
b.pitch = <span class="number">2</span>  

c = Drums({  
  kit:<span class="string">'beatbox'</span>,  
  note:<span class="string">'Tfk8p'</span>  
})</code></pre>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>pitch</em> : Float. default range { .25, 4 }. default value 1. The speed of sample playback.</li>
<li><em>amp</em> : Float. default range { 0, 1 }. default value: 1.</li>
<li><em>pan</em>: Float. Default range { -1, 1 }. Default value: 0. The position in the stereo spectrum of the Drums output.</li>
<li><em>kick</em>: Ugen. The kick drum sampler.</li>
<li><em>snare</em>: Ugen. The snare drum sampler.</li>
<li><em>hat</em>: Ugen. The hihat sampler.</li>
<li><em>seq</em>: Sequencer. The built-in Seq object.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>note</em>( Float:frequency, Float:amp(optional) ) : This method tells the drum kit to play a single note.</li>
<li><em>play</em>( Array:frequencies, Array:durations ) : This method accepts arrays of frequencies and durations as arguments to create and start a sequencer targeting the oscillator.</li>
<li><em>stop</em>() : This method stops the sequencer that is built into the oscillator if it has been started.</li>
<li><em>kill</em>() : Disconnect the Drums from whatever bus it is connected to. </li>
</ul>
