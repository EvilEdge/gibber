<h1 id="patchbay">Patchbay</h1>
<p>A simple widget for establishing virtual connections. After creating connections via drag and drop,
users can delete them by clicking on the connection and hitting delete. TODO: how to delete for touch devices?</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>a = Mono()
b = Drums(&#39;xoxo&#39;)

c = Patchbay( a.Cutoff, a.Resonance, b.Pitch, b.Amp, b.Out )</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, connecting the patch point for b.Out to the patch point for a.Cutoff would be the equivalent
of executing the following line of code:</p>
<pre><code>a.cutoff = b.Out</code></pre>
